The top level works as an eclipse workspace.  The 'public_html_spring' directory is an eclipse project.  The easiest way to get the Spring framework working is to download the Eclipse-based Spring Tool Suite: http://spring.io/tools/sts.

Then after doing this, make the workspace your root of the git repo, and open the project "public_html_spring".
